# Second Submission

- Code coverage tool / expanded test coverage
- AI Performance

# Probably Never

- Stop crashing on window resize
  - Running a pad rather than a screen through all of those methods I wrote
    would be a great example of liskoff substitution in action.
- Put either AI or UI into a separate thread
- Test Ansible installer on OSX

# DONE

- Add sound (probably requires multithreading?)
  - try espeak, maybe pyglet? (went with espeak)
- Handle game overs more gracefully:
  - Allow taking back final move
  - Keep playing until the player decides to quit.
- Improve error handling / state validation
  - each class should offer exception-throwing and boolean-based 
    validation methods.
  - Stop crashing on failed moves
- Prompt for player and computer names
  - cheated and am using a json config file for now
- Last Minute Renderer Fixes
  - Show player move immediately
  - Do not attempt AI move after player victory
- Curses Renderer Refactor
  - Break it into modules, at least
    - screen manipulation
    - game logic
    - voice
